First clone the repository

Open the project on VS Code

Install Flask in the virtual environment by running the following command in the VS Code Terminal : python -m pip install flask

Now run the app.py file : In the Integrated Terminal, run the app by entering the command python -m flask run, which runs the Flask development server. The development server looks for app.py by default. When you run Flask, you should see the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ URL. If you see an error that the Flask module cannot be found, make sure you've run python -m pip install flask in your virtual environment.

To open your default browser to the rendered page, Ctrl+click the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ URL in the terminal.
